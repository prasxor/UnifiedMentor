Welcome to Nova, your platform for blogging and sharing your ideas with the world. Let’s walk through what Nova has to offer.

At the top of the homepage, you’ll find a simple and user-friendly navigation bar. On the left is the Nova logo. In the center are navigation links: Home, Create Blog, and About Me. On the right, there’s a toggle to switch between light and dark themes.

Just below the navbar, you’ll see a search bar that helps you quickly find blog posts. There's also a categories dropdown that lets you filter posts by topics, making it easy to find content that interests you.

As you scroll down, you’ll come across blog cards. Each card features a cover image, the blog title, publication date, category tags, and a short description. Clicking on any card takes you to the full blog post on a dedicated page.

To create your own blog, click the “Create Blog” button. You’ll be asked to enter the title, a short description, a cover image URL, and select a category. Once that’s done, click “Next” to move to the editor.

The editor includes everything you need to format your post. You can use bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough. There are tools for adding code blocks, headings, paragraphs, quotes, bullet points, and numbered lists. You can also align text, insert links and images, change text colors, highlight content, and use undo, redo, or clear formatting options. Once you're finished, click “Publish Blog” to post it.

After publishing, your blog post will appear instantly as a new card on the homepage for readers to discover.
